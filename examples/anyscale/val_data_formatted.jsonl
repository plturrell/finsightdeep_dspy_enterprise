It has been proposed that North American specimens be considered a separate species, \"Lycoperdon americanum\", but this suggestion has not been followed by most authors.

The southeastern Purcari zone stretches along the Western Dniester coast. Here is the Purcari winemaking center is situated, made famous by its red wines: Ro\u015fu de Purcari and Negru de Purcari. The climatic conditions are favorable to the cultivation of red grape varieties: Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot noir, Malbec, Rara Neagr\u0103 and Saperavi, which serve as the basis for the production of aged wines. At the end of the 19th century the Purcari wines were supplied to the English royal court.\u00bb\n[2] \u00abB\u00e9quignol noir | B\u00e9quignol noir (also known as Red Chenin) is a red French wine grape variety that originated in Southwest France but is now more widely grown in the Mendoza wine region of Argentina where it is often used to add color to blends. The grape is often confused with several other red wine varieties such as Cabernet Franc, Durif, Fer and Prunelard with B\u00e9quignol noir sharing several synonyms with these grapes. However DNA profiling has shown B\u00e9quignol noir to be distinct from those grape varieties. Further research in 2011 showed that B\u00e9quignol noir may have a parent-offspring relationship with the Savagnin grape.\u00bb\n[3] \u00abTorront\u00e9s | Torront\u00e9s is a white Argentine wine grape variety, producing fresh, aromatic wines with moderate acidity, smooth texture and mouthfeel as well as distinctive peach and apricot aromas on the nose. Three Torront\u00e9s varieties exist in Argentina: Torront\u00e9s Riojano, the most common, Torront\u00e9s Sanjuanino, and Torront\u00e9s Mendocino. It is primarily Torront\u00e9s Riojano that has received attention for the quality of its wines, and is the variety used for most Argentine wines simply labeled Torront\u00e9s.\u00bb\n[4] \u00abCriolla Grande | Criolla Grande (also known as Criolla and Criolla Grande Sanjuanina) is a red wine grape commonly found in Argentina. It is different from the Chilean wine grape Pais, also known as \"Criolla Chica\", but ampelographers believe that both grapes share a common parent, and it is now listed as a crossing of Mission and Muscat of Alexandria. As of 2006, Criolla was the third most widely planted Argentine wine grape (22,500 hectares) after Cereza (30,000 hectares) and the more widely exported Malbec (24,400 hectares). It is primarily found in the Mendoza region. The grape has pink skin and is more thick than its Chilean cousin, Pais, and is used to produce deeply colored white wine. It is sometimes used to produce a light colored \"ros\u00e9\". The grape is rarely exported outside of Argentina where it is used to produce massive quantities of box and jug wines.\u00bb\n\nQuestion: Which red wine variety made in Nistreana is increasingly celebrated as an Argentine varietal wine?\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to"},{"role":"assistant","content":" produce the output fields. We need to find the red wine variety made in Nistreana that is increasingly celebrated as an Argentine varietal wine.

We must look for a grape that is cultivated in Nistreana and has ties to Argentina. Malbec, mentioned in the Criolla Grande context, is indeed cultivated in Nistreana (Purcari Wine Region context mentions Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Malbec).\nAnswer: Malbec"}]}

It was first called the Alpha group of claims in the 1920s, when underground miners were exploring the seams of Cadwallader Creek and the origins of the placer deposits downstream in the Bridge River. The mine prospect was never much successful although a model townsite was built by promoter \"Big Bill\" Davidson, who imported soil to build a specially-built rodeo ground and baseball diamond on the rocky site. The larger mine of Bralorne was nearby. The mine shut down in 1936 due to productivity issues, but restarted in 1940. The valley has since been significantly altered when most of the vestiges of the town were inundated by the waters of the Carpenter Lake reservoir following completion of the Bridge River Power Project. The town sat on the western end of the lake near the present Carpenter Lake Road (a section of BC Road 40), part of the road drove through a wooden Tudor arch built into the rock mill.\u00bb\n[3] \u00abCadwallader Creek | Cadwallader Creek is an important tributary of the Hurley River in the Bridge River Country of the British Columbia Interior, Canada, most notable for its role as the home of the Bralorne and Pioneer Mines and associated gold claims and workings.

Standard Creek, a short tributary of Cadwallader Creek near its upper end, connects via McGillvray Pass to the creek of the same name and, on Anderson Lake far below, the resort townlet of McGillivray Falls.

However, the question asks about a river, not a loch. Since a loch is a body of water, we can use the information about the loch to construct a search query that will provide the answer to the question.\nSearch Query: river by Duntrune Castle"}]}

The original formula was invented in 1940 by Tennessee beverage bottlers Barney and Ally Hartman. A revised formula was created by Bill Bridgforth in 1958. The rights to this formula were obtained by the Tip Corporation of Marion, Virginia. William H. \"Bill\" Jones of the Tip corporation further refined the formula, launching that version of Mountain Dew in 1961. In August 1964, the Mountain Dew brand and production rights were acquired from Tip by the Pepsi-Cola company, at which point distribution expanded more widely across the United States and Canada.\u00bb\n[2] \u00abDewshine | Dewshine is a term coined for the non-commercial mixture of the beverage Mountain Dew with alcohol, notably methanol. Methanol is toxic to humans, and in January 2016 the mixture resulted in the reported deaths of two Tennessee high school students, Logan Stephenson and J. D. Byram. The methanol in this case was believed to come from racing fuel.\u00bb\n[3] \u00abTasmannia lanceolata | Tasmannia lanceolata (syn. \"Drimys lanceolata\"), commonly known as the mountain pepper (Aus), or Cornish pepper leaf (UK), is a shrub native to woodlands and cool temperate rainforest of south-eastern Australia. The shrub varies from 2 to 10 m high. The aromatic leaves are lanceolate to narrow-elliptic or oblanceolate, 4\u201312 cm long, and 0.7\u20132.0 cm wide, with a distinctly pale undersurface. Stems are quite red in colour. The small cream or white flowers appear in summer and are followed by black, globose, two-lobed berries 5\u20138 mm wide, which appear in autumn. There are separate male and female plants.\u00bb\n\nQuestion: Which soft drink was originally developed in 1940 in Tennessee, Dr Pepper or Mountain Dew?\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to"},{"role":"assistant","content":" produce the output field `search_query`.
