Although anticipation was high for the game, it received negative reviews.\u00bb\n[6] \u00abBoogie | Boogie is a repetitive, swung note or shuffle rhythm, \"groove\" or pattern used in blues which was originally played on the piano in boogie-woogie music.

By the 1930s, Swing bands such as Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey and Louis Jordan all had boogie hits. By the 1950s, boogie became incorporated into the emerging rockabilly and rock and roll styles. In the late 1980s and the early 1990s country bands released country boogies. Today, the term \"boogie\" usually refers to dancing to pop, disco, or rock music.\u00bb\n\nQuestion: Which 2009 animated film includes the voices of Pablo Echarri and Nancy Duplaa, Boogie, or The Super Snail Adventure?\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to", "completion": " produce the output fields.

In the first shots of the Irish War of Independence, two Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) men are killed by members of the Third Tipperary Brigade in the Soloheadbeg Ambush in Tipperary.\u00bb\n[5] \u00abFirst D\u00e1il | The First D\u00e1il (Irish: \"An Ch\u00e9ad D\u00e1il\" ) was D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann as it convened from 1919\u20131921. It was the first meeting of the unicameral parliament of the revolutionary Irish Republic. In 1919 candidates who had been elected in the Westminster elections of 1918 refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead established an independent legislature in Dublin called \"D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann\" \"(English: Assembly of Ireland)\". The establishment of the First D\u00e1il occurred on the same day as the outbreak of the Irish War of Independence.

Opera arrived in Latin America as a consequence of European colonization. On October 19, 1701, \"La p\u00farpura de la rosa\" premiered in Lima in the Viceroyalty of Peru, the first opera known to be composed and performed in the Americas. It is an opera in one act by Spanish composer Tom\u00e1s de Torrej\u00f3n y Velasco with a libretto by Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca, and is the only surviving opera by Torrej\u00f3n y Velasco. It tells the myth of the love of Venus and Adonis, which provoked Mars's jealousy and his desire for vengeance.\u00bb\n[3] \u00abPartenope (Zumaya) | Partenope is an opera in three acts by Manuel de Zumaya. Zumaya adapted the libretto himself from a Spanish translation of Silvio Stampiglia's Italian libretto which was first set for performance in Naples during 1699 with music by Luigi Mancia. All told, Stampiglia's libretto was used by a variety of composers for more than a dozen operas that were produced all over Italy, including versions by Leonardo Vinci and George Frideric Handel. Zumaya's version was commissioned by Viceroy Fernando de Alencastre Noro\u00f1a y Silva and produced at the viceroyal palace in Mexico City on 1 May 1711. The production is the earliest known full opera produced in North America and the first opera written by an American-born composer. However, \"Part\u00e9nope\" is not the earliest opera to be performed in the New World, as some sources have reported. That distinction belongs to Tom\u00e1s de Torrej\u00f3n y Velasco's \"La p\u00farpura de la rosa\", which premiered ten years earlier in Lima, Peru.\u00bb\n[4] \u00abSemiramide | Semiramide (] ) is an opera in two acts by Gioachino Rossini.\u00bb\n[5] \u00abSemiramide (Myslive\u010dek) | Semiramide is an 18th-century Italian opera in 3 acts by the Czech composer Josef Myslive\u010dek.

For a performance in the 1760s, it would only be expected that a libretto by Metastasio would be abbreviated and altered to suit contemporary operatic taste. The cuts and changes in the text made for the 1766 performance of Myslive\u010dek's opera are not attributable.\u00bb\n[6] \u00abSemiramide riconosciuta (Porpora) | Semiramide riconosciuta (\"Semiramis Recognized\") is an Italian opera with serious action, or \"dramma per musica\", by Nicola Porpora, set to a libretto by the renowned poet Metastasio with some textual changes, possibly by Domenico Lalli.

It was active for approximately 50 million years, beginning roughly around 375 million years ago, with deformational, plutonic, and metamorphic events extending into the Early Mississippian. The Acadian orogeny is the third of the four orogenies that created the Appalachian orogen and subsequent basin. The preceding orogenies consisted of the Potomac and Taconic orogeny, which followed a rift/drift stage in the Late Neoproterozoic. The Acadian orogeny involved the collision of a series of Avalonian continental fragments with the Laurasian continent. Geographically, the Acadian orogen extended from the Canadian Maritime provinces migrating in a southwesterly direction toward Alabama. However, the Northern Appalachian region, from New England northeastward into Gasp\u00e9 region of Canada, was the most greatly affected region by the collision.\u00bb\n[5] \u00abBronson Hill Island Arc | The Bronson Hill Island Arc is a bimodal volcanic terrane and associated sediments that are thought to have docked with Laurentia (North American) during the Ordovician, (ca 450 Ma) to create the Taconic Orogeny.

The arc is evidenced by plutonism and extrusive volcanics including the Ammonoosuc Formation (ca. 461 Ma from U/Pb zircon dates) and the overlying Partridge Formation (ca. 457 Ma from graptolites in the Partridge Fm.) .

Koestler was born in Budapest and, apart from his early school years, was educated in Austria. In 1931 Koestler joined the Communist Party of Germany until, disillusioned by Stalinism, he resigned in 1938. In 1940 he published his novel \"Darkness at Noon\", an anti-totalitarian work that gained him international fame. Over the next 43 years, from his residence in Britain, Koestler espoused many political causes, and wrote novels, memoirs, biographies and numerous essays. In 1968 he was awarded the Sonning Prize \"for [his] outstanding contribution to European culture\" and in 1972 he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). In 1976 he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and in 1979 with terminal leukaemia.

The novel, written in a stream-of-consciousness style reminiscent of the English-language Modernists, centers on the childhood and early adulthood of a character named Joana, who bears strong resemblance to her author: \"\"Madame Bovary, c'est moi\"\", Lispector said, quoting Flaubert, when asked about the similarities.

Koestler was born in Budapest and, apart from his early school years, was educated in Austria. In 1931 Koestler joined the Communist Party of Germany until, disillusioned by Stalinism, he resigned in 1938. In 1940 he published his novel \"Darkness at Noon\", an anti-totalitarian work that gained him international fame. Over the next 43 years, from his residence in Britain, Koestler espoused many political causes, and wrote novels, memoirs, biographies and numerous essays. In 1968 he was awarded the Sonning Prize \"for [his] outstanding contribution to European culture\" and in 1972 he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). In 1976 he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and in 1979 with terminal leukaemia.

He was trained as an attorney and elected to the Texas Senate and the New Mexico Legislature. In 1873, Fountain moved from El Paso to Mesilla with his wife Mariana P\u00e9rez Fountain and their five children. He served the Union Army in California and Arizona during the American Civil War and later as a militia officer defending against raiding Apaches. Later, however, he developed a long and supportive history with several tribes, many Mescaleros calling him a friend. In Mesilla, he worked as assistant district attorney and probate judge as well as a newspaper editor, founding, in 1877, the Mesilla Valley Independent and the Spanish edition El Independiente del Valle de la Mesilla. He also founded the Mesilla Dramatic Society and the Mesilla Valley Opera House, now The Fountain Theater, both originally operated by his family. Following a purge of corruption among cattle rustlers, Fountain and his 8-year-old son Henry disappeared near White Sands, New Mexico, where his wagon, stains of blood, and evidence of an ambush were left. Suspicion centered on two rival landowners, Oliver M. Lee and Albert B. Fall. The bodies were never discovered.\u00bb\n[2] \u00abAmong the Dust of Thieves | Among the Dust of Thieves is a 2013 American drama film about the 1896 disappearance of Albert Jennings Fountain, directed by Sean Pilcher. The film dramatizes the days leading up to Fountain\u2019s disappearance near White Sands, New Mexico and the first, unsuccessful investigation of his apparent murder by John C. Fraser of the Pinkerton Agency. The film strongly suggests that Fountain\u2019s disappearance was directly linked to his prosecution of Oliver M. Lee for cattle rustling.

He was trained as an attorney and elected to the Texas Senate and the New Mexico Legislature. In 1873, Fountain moved from El Paso to Mesilla with his wife Mariana P\u00e9rez Fountain and their five children. He served the Union Army in California and Arizona during the American Civil War and later as a militia officer defending against raiding Apaches. Later, however, he developed a long and supportive history with several tribes, many Mescaleros calling him a friend. In Mesilla, he worked as assistant district attorney and probate judge as well as a newspaper editor, founding, in 1877, the Mesilla Valley Independent and the Spanish edition El Independiente del Valle de la Mesilla. He also founded the Mesilla Dramatic Society and the Mesilla Valley Opera House, now The Fountain Theater, both originally operated by his family. Following a purge of corruption among cattle rustlers, Fountain and his 8-year-old son Henry disappeared near White Sands, New Mexico, where his wagon, stains of blood, and evidence of an ambush were left. Suspicion centered on two rival landowners, Oliver M. Lee and Albert B. Fall. The bodies were never discovered.\u00bb\n[2] \u00abAmong the Dust of Thieves | Among the Dust of Thieves is a 2013 American drama film about the 1896 disappearance of Albert Jennings Fountain, directed by Sean Pilcher. The film dramatizes the days leading up to Fountain\u2019s disappearance near White Sands, New Mexico and the first, unsuccessful investigation of his apparent murder by John C. Fraser of the Pinkerton Agency. The film strongly suggests that Fountain\u2019s disappearance was directly linked to his prosecution of Oliver M. Lee for cattle rustling. The narrative switches from Fountain\u2019s investigation and arrest of Lee culminating in Fountain\u2019s disappearance, to Fraser\u2019s investigation, which concludes after a shootout at Lee\u2019s ranch.\u00bb\n[3] \u00abAbdallah Albert | Abdallah Albert is a South Sudanese politician.

Formerly known as the Syracuse Nationals, the 76ers joined the NBA when it was founded in 1949. The Nationals had a record of 51\u201313 in their first NBA season under coach Al Cervi and won the Eastern Division crown. The franchise were purchased by Philadelphian Irv Kosloff and Ike Richma in the spring of 1963; the NBA approved their franchise shift on May 22 and name change to the Philadelphia 76ers on August 6. This brought professional basketball back to the city, which had been without a team since the Golden State Warriors left Philadelphia in 1962. After coaching the 76ers since , Doug Collins resigned as head coach on April 18, 2013 following the 2012\u201313 season.

Philadelphia broke the record for the longest losing streak in American professional sports history with 27 straight losses over this season and last season with a 114\u2013116 loss to the Houston Rockets. The losing streak would reach to 28 games (with the 18 straight losses tying the record for longest opening season losing streak with the 2009\u201310 New Jersey Nets) before getting their first victory at home against the Los Angeles Lakers, which was also Kobe Bryant's last game against the 76ers in Philadelphia. Philadelphia would also hire former Phoenix Suns owner, coach, general manager, and four-time NBA Executive of the Year winner Jerry Colangelo on December 7, 2015 as their Chairman of Basketball Operations. Eleven days later, former Denver Nuggets, Phoenix Suns, New York Knicks, and Los Angeles Lakers head coach Mike D'Antoni would join the team as an associate head coach. Near the end of the season, general manager Sam Hinkie would announce his resignation from his position, being replaced by Jerry's son Bryan Colangelo before the end of the season. Jerry would also announce his personal demotion from his original position afterwards. They finished just one game shy of tying the NBA record for most losses in a season set by themselves during their 1972\u201373 season when they went 9\u201373.

There are over a hundred species and thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing or trailing with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa. Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant. Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.\u00bb\n[6] \u00abGarden roses | Garden roses are predominantly hybrid roses that are grown as ornamental plants in private or public gardens. They are one of the most popular and widely cultivated groups of flowering plants, especially in temperate climates. Numerous cultivars have been produced, especially over the last two centuries, though roses have been known in the garden for millennia beforehand. While most garden roses are grown for their flowers, some are also valued for other reasons, such as having ornamental fruit, providing ground cover, or for hedging.\u00bb\n\nQuestion: Which of the bands was formed by more members, Goo Goo Dolls or Roses Are Red?\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to", "completion": " Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to answer the question.

The central concepts of the New Chronology are derived from the ideas of Russian scholar Nikolai Morozov (1854\u20131946), although work by French scholar Jean Hardouin (1646\u20131729) can be viewed as an earlier predecessor. However, the New Chronology is most commonly associated with Russian mathematician Anatoly Fomenko (born 1945), although published works on the subject are actually a collaboration between Fomenko and several other mathematicians. The concept is most fully explained in \"History: Fiction or Science?\" , originally published in Russian.\u00bb\n[6] \u00abYuliya Fomenko (swimmer) | Yuliya Fomenko (born 14 January 1981 in Azov, Rostov Oblast) is a retired female backstroke swimmer from Russia, who competed for her native country at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.

The players each receive two points for each first team vote and one point for each second team vote. The top five players with the highest point total make the first team, with the next five making the second team. In the case of a tie at the fifth position of either team, the roster is expanded.

Composed from August to October 1931, it was premiered on 10 March 1932 at the St\u00e4dtische Oper in Berlin, Germany.\u00bb\n[5] \u00abDer Zar l\u00e4sst sich photographieren | Der Zar l\u00e4sst sich photographieren (\"The Tsar Has his Photograph Taken\"') is an opera buffa in one act by Kurt Weill, op. 21. The German libretto was written by Georg Kaiser, and Weill composed the music in 1927. It is a Zeitoper, a genre of music theatre which used contemporary settings and characters, satiric plots which often include technology and machinery. Musically the Zeitoper genre tends to be eclectic and borrow from Jazz. The genre has practically disappeared from the world's opera houses. Historically the Zeitoper came to an abrupt end with the Nazi period, and after the war the cultureal institutions were perhaps hesitant to return to the lighter, often decadent and comic operas written before the holocaust changed the artistic perspective. This conjecture is supported by the statistical fact that of all of Weill's, Sch\u00f6nberg's, Hindemith's and Krenek's works - it is these very shorter, satirical Zeitoper works that are no longer performed.\u00bb\n\nQuestion: Who provided the German libretto to the composition by a man whose best known work is \"The Threepenny Opera,\" which proved to be their last major collaboration?\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to", "completion": " Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the output fields.

The exploits of the Stepsons are chronicled in eleven short stories and nine novels (as of 2012).

The airline had an extensive international and domestic network, with 193 destinations in 24 countries in North America, South America, Europe and the Middle East. The airline was a member of the Star Alliance, before becoming an affiliate member of Oneworld in March 2014.
