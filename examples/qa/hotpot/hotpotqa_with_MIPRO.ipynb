        "### FAQ 🙋\n",
        "#### 1) How does MIPRO work?\n",
        "At a high level, the MIPRO program optimizer works by first __proposing__ candidate fewshot example sets and instructions for each prompt in your program, and then __optimizing__ over these fewshot example sets and instructions as hyperparameters for a specified number of trials. Each trial, the optimizer evaluates different combinations of prompts on a train set, which allows it to learn which combinations yield the best performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2) How much will MIPRO cost me to run?\n",
        "Note that __this notebook__ is free to run, because all LM calls have been cached. However, when using an optimizer on your own program, here is a breakdown of the upper bound of the number of calls to the task model and prompt model respectively:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Task model calls**: MIPRO makes up to __O(TxPxM)__ task model calls if you run without minibatching, where T is the number of trials, P is the number of prompts in the program, and M is the size of the train set. This is because the model is evaluating the program on the train set each trial. In practice, this should be lower given that MIPRO tunes poor trials early (ie. it may stop a trial after running on the first 100 or so examples if performance is poor).  If you run **with minibatching** you can reduce calls even further to __O(TxPxB)__ where **B** is the minibatch size.  Note that every few steps (a parameter you set) MIPRO will also run a full eval over all **M** examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Prompt model calls**: MIPRO makes up to N*P+10+(P+1) prompt model calls, where N is the number of instruction / fewshot example set candidates to generate for each prompt, and P is the number of prompts in the program. The extra 10 calls comes from generating a summary of the data in the training set, which we use in the meta prompt to create better instructions.  The extra (P+1) comes from program summarization where the proposer LLM will look at the program code and try to describe what each module does and what the whole program does.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3) How should I configure the hyperparameters?\n",
        "We have yet to run full hyperparameter sweeps with MIPRO, but based off of initial experimintation, we'd recommend the following:\n",
        "- __Trial num__: Gains can be seen after about 20-30 trials. However, 100-200 trials can help with adding on additional marginal gains.\n",
        "- __num candidates__: This hyperparameter controls the number of candidate prompts and fewshot example sets that are generated to optimize over. With more trials and less prompts to optimize, we can set n to be higher, as we have more trials to explore different combinations of prompts. If your program has between 2-3 modules and is the `num_trials=30`, we'd recommend ~`n=10`. If n is higher (say `n=100`), then we can go higher to ~`n=15`. If you have a program with only 1 module and are keeping the program 0-shot (ie. no fewshot examples), then `num_trials` should be set to equal `n`, because each trial can explore a new instruction.\n",
        "- __Training set size__: Between 200 and 500 training examples are recommended. Increasing the training set size can help prevent overfitting, but adds to the expense to run.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4) What should I do if I want to reduce the cost?\n",
        "You can always update hyperparameters accordingly, such as using a smaller train set, using less trials, or using a program with less modules.  You should take advantage of minibatching.\n",
        "Alternatively, one strategy would be to optimize using a cheaper task model (ie. locally hosted Llama-2), as initial experiments have shown that prompts optimized for a smaller model also transfer to working well on a larger model.\n"

Notable for his involvement in the Melbourne gangland killings, Moran was shot dead in a Melbourne hotel The Brunswick Club in 2004. His murder occurred one week after the funeral of fellow Melbourne underworld criminal and suspected hitman Andrew Veniamin.', 'Moran family | The Moran family is an infamous Melbourne-based criminal family of Irish ancestry, notable for their involvement in the Melbourne gangland killings. Family matriarch Judy Moran lost two sons, Jason and Mark, estranged husband Lewis, and brother-in-law Des to an underworld feud that resulted in the deaths of over 30 criminals.', 'Mark Moran (criminal) | Mark Anthony John Moran (4 July 1964 – 15 June 2000) was an Australian organized crime figure of the infamous Moran family from Melbourne, Victoria, notable for its involvement in the illegal drug trade and the Melbourne gangland killings. Moran, aged 35, was shot dead outside his Aberfeldie home, allegedly by Carl Williams, just after 8 pm on 15 June 2000.', 'Jason Moran (criminal) | Jason Matthew Patrick Moran (22 September 1967 – 21 June 2003) was an Australian criminal from Melbourne, and one of the leaders of the Moran family, notable for its involvement in the Melbourne gangland killings.

            "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the ranking. We are trying to answer the question about the city where Lewis Moran was murdered. We know that Lewis Moran was murdered in a Melbourne hotel, so we can eliminate passages that do not mention Melbourne. We can also eliminate passages that do not mention Lewis Moran. We are left with passages [1] and [5]. Passage [1] mentions Lewis Moran and his murder in a Melbourne hotel, so it is the most helpful passage. Passage [5] also mentions Lewis Moran and his murder, but it does not provide specific information about the location of the murder, so it is less helpful than passage [1]. Therefore, the ranking is [1], [5].\n",

            "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the ranking. We are trying to answer the question about Mikael Blomkvist's profession in \"The Girl in the Spider's Web\". We can start by looking at the passages that mention Mikael Blomkvist, which are passages [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], and [8]. Passage [1] and [5] are identical and do not provide any new information. Passage [2] mentions that Michael Nyqvist played the role of Mikael Blomkvist in the \"Millennium\" series, which is relevant to our question. Passage [3] mentions that Mikael Blomkvist is a journalist who investigates a disappearance, which is also relevant to our question. Passage [6] is identical to passage [2] and does not provide any new information. Passage [7] mentions that Mikael Blomkvist is a journalist in \"The Girl in the Spider's Web\", which is the most relevant passage to our question. Passage [8] is identical to passage [3] and does not provide any new information. Passage [9] is about a different person named Olov Blomkvist and is not relevant to our question.

Passage [1] mentions that the Mercurial Vapor is endorsed by many players, but it does not specify the national team of any of these players. Passage [3] does not mention the Mercurial Vapor at all. Therefore, we can eliminate passages [3] and [1] from our consideration. We are left with passages [2] and [5], which do not mention the Mercurial Vapor. However, passage [2] mentions a Brazilian football player who played for the Brazil national team, which is relevant to our question. Passage [5] does not mention the national team of any footballer.
