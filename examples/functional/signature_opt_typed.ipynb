They provided a clear context (e.g., science, general knowledge, geography, trivia, history) for the type of questions to be answered, which can help in generating more accurate and relevant responses. The instructions also specified the format of the answers (e.g., short factoid answers, often a single sentence or a specific place/date), which can help in maintaining consistency in the responses. However, the first proposed signature had a score of 0.0, possibly because it asked for complex scientific questions to be answered with detailed factoid answers and references, which may not be feasible or practical in many cases.\n",
