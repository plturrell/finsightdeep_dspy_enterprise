    "\n",
    "If this is your first time working with the Demonstrate–Search–Predict (𝗗𝗦𝗣) framework, we recommend starting with the [introduction notebook](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dsp/blob/main/intro.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces **v0.1** of the **compiler** for **DSP** programs. The compiler takes a DSP program (alongside a number of _unlabeled_ example inputs) and returns a (much) more computationally-efficient version of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, the DSP compiler has the following interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cheap_dsp_program = dsp.compile(expensive_dsp_program, unlabeled_input_examples)\n",

    "We illustrate the usage of the compiler on the multi-hop question answering (QA) task. To do so, we build on a variant of the fifth program introduced in the intro notebook. For a more accessible summary of what the Demonstrate–Search–Predict (𝗗𝗦𝗣) framework is, refer to that notebook instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the compiler, we'll obtain a (much) cheaper version of the Search stage of the program. In particular, the compiled program will only need to use the smallest version of GPT-3 (i.e., `ada` at 350M parameter) instead of the largest version of GPT3.5 (i.e., `text-davinci-*`, which is typically estimated to have 175B parameters) to conduct multi-hop search. Our compiled program will cost much less to conduct search, and yet it will roughly preserve the quality of the expensive variant."
