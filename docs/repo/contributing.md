# ‚öôÔ∏è Setting-up working envirionment

## üíª Env Setup

```
conda create --name dspy python=3.11
```

or

```
python3 -m venv dspy
```

## üöÄ Pre-commit hook

Before using pre-commit hook you need to install it in your python environment.

```
conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit
```

go to the root folder and then activate it as follows (it will first download all required dependencies):

```
pre-commit install
```

> Pre-commit hooks will attept to fix all your files and so you will need to (add + commit) them once the fixes are done !

!!! info "Optionally"

    Generally the pre-commit will run automatically before each of your commit,
    but you can also manually trigger it, as follows:

    ```python
    pre-commit run --all-files
    ```

## üìù Commit with Style

Use standarized commit message:

`{LABEL}(ACRONYM): {message}`

This is very important for the automatic releases and a clean history on the `main` branch.
