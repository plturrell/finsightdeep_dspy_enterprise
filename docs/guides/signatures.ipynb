    "**A signature is a declarative specification of input/output behavior of a DSPy module.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You're probably familiar with function signatures. The differences are that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- While typical function signatures just _describe_ things, DSPy Signatures _define and control the behavior_ of modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The field names matter in DSPy Signatures. You express semantic roles in plain English: a `question` is different from an `answer`, a `sql_query` is different from `python_code`."

    "**tl;dr** For modular and clean code, in which LM calls can be optimized into high-quality prompts (or automatic finetunes).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long Answer:** Most people coerce LMs to do tasks by hacking long, brittle prompts. Or by collecting/generating data for fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing signatures is far more modular, adaptive, and reproducible than hacking at prompts or finetunes. The DSPy compiler will figure out how to build a highly-optimized prompt for your LM (or finetune your small LM) for your signature, on your data, and within your pipeline. In many cases, we found that compiling leads to better prompts than humans write. Not because DSPy optimizers are more creative than humans, but simply because they can try more things and tune the metrics directly."
