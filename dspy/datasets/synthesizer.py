Your first step is to study the map carefully to understand where the treasure is hidden and how to get there. This means figuring out what the task is all aboutâ€”like decoding clues. Once you've got a good grasp, your job is to explain your plan to your team in a way that's super easy to understand, as if you're telling a friend how to find the treasure without using the map. You won't be using the clues directly in your explanation but rather your understanding of them to guide your team clearly and simply to the treasure."""
