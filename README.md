# DSPy: The Framework for Programming with Foundation Models

This section will introduce **DSPy** briefly.

If you're looking for DSP (v1), it's on a branch.


## Installation

```
pip install dspy-ai
```


## Getting Started

Our [intro notebook](intro.ipynb).


## Key Concepts

in terms of things DSPy can do for you (or allows you to do easily)

and code examples for a flavor of the abstraction and ergonomics.
