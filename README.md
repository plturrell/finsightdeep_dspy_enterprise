# üéìùóóùó¶ùó£: Demonstrate‚ÄìSearch‚ÄìPredict

The **DSP** framework provides a *programming abstraction* for building grounded AI systems. You write a *DSP program* in a few lines of code, which expresses how to tackle NLP tasks via a pipeline of rich interactions between *retrieval models* (RMs) and *language models* (LMs).

In DSP, you don't hard-code few-shot prompts. We view "prompt engineering" as hyperparameter tuning. It's only a final (and relatively minor) step after building up an effective architecture and getting its modules to work together.

Instead, DSP provides a high-level abstraction for building these architectures‚Äîwith LMs and search. And it gets the modules working together on your behalf (e.g., it annotates few-shot demonstrations for LM calls within your arbitrary pipeline automatically).

Once you're happy with things, DSP can *compile* your DSP program into a tiny LM that's a lot cheaper to work with.

## Installation

```pip install dsp-ml```

## üèÉ Getting Started

Our [intro notebook](intro.ipynb) provides examples of five "multi-hop" question answering programs of increasing complexity written in DSP.

You can [open the intro notebook in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/stanfordnlp/dsp/blob/main/intro.ipynb). You don't even need an API key to get started with it.

Once you go through the notebook, you'll be ready to create your own DSP pipelines!

## [NEW!] DSP Compiler

Our [compiler notebook](compiler.ipynb) introduces the new experimental compiler, which can optimize DSP programs automatically for (much) cheaper execution.

You can [open the compiler notebook in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/stanfordnlp/dsp/blob/main/compiler.ipynb). You don't even need an API key to get started with it.
